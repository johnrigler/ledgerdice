# ledgerdice

This project is designed to be hosted on
IPFS. It includes Javascript components that
probably aren't allowed on github.


- dice.html ( The man program )
- index.html ( The intro page that sets the APIKEY )
- jquery-3.2.1.min.js ( Standard Package: QmQF1xTuqsbRy3NSL21wQooJxwHijpoBDv65nMivhD194B ) 
- methods.js ( Vanilla Javascript Library )
- web3-1_3_6.min.js ( Standard Package: Qmb3K8jjzBXrR4df48TTMELRPrKxeFZbBuLvhGVg8t1Wy6 )




Because this project doesn't use Nodejs, it might seem
strange at first. Good luck.
