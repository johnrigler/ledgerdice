<h1>On-Chain Polygon Dice </h1>


<div>
<pre>
This dice game comes with no warranty. Randomness is based on both transaction and block hashes. Because of 
the unique way that this game reads this information, a special "ledger history" api must be used. It requires
a free access key. I have put in mine as the default below. If you are really serious about Web 3 
and availability, then follow the link below to get your.

Because dice can be used in gambling, I have chosen to host this game in IPFS. When you are playing, you 
are not my customer and therefore I have no legal responsibility to regulate how you use this software.

This version varies slightly from the description laid out in the attached smart contract because it uses both
block and hash variables as a source of randomness. The smart contract describes a slightly less robust 
solution where a games could front-run by altering their transaction nounce.
